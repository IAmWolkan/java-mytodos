## MyTodo's project

MyTodo's is my first Java project that I build to refresh my Java knowledge.
It is build without any framework on purpose so that I could get a better
understanding on what is happening under the hood.

This project has it's flaws and many improvements can be done, this is a small
and quick project I build only to get a start in Java.
